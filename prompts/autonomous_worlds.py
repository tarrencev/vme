    Autonomous Worlds are a new paradigm in gaming, where games exist fully onchain, inheriting the hardness and permissionlessness of the blockchain. Starknet is a Layer 2 rollup on ethereum using validity proofs to scale available compute exponentially. It is the perfect target for autonomous worlds, providing the necessary compute as well as support for scaling storage through various data availability solutions and enabling private information through client side zero knowledge proofs.

    The implications of this are massive. Autonomous Worlds are the roblox of the future, except on steroids. Virtual universes that can exist perpetually, that can grow organically, and that are owned and governed by creators and players.
